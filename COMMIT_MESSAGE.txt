Add indent command for indentation repair and clean up project structure

Latest Changes:
• Added 'indent' command to terminal editor for checking and repairing document indentation
• Implemented iterative indentation repair algorithm with cascading fix detection
• Added comprehensive validation system for hierarchy consistency
• Fixed terminal display indentation to match HTML export (first level = no indent)
• Enhanced MarkdownEditor with repair_indentation() method
• Added warning system for structural issues and excessive nesting
• Updated help documentation with new indent command

Project Cleanup:
• Moved test/debug scripts from root to test/ directory
• Moved demo scripts from root to examples/ directory  
• Removed temporary files (shopping_list_analysis_report.txt, cmd_test_export_config.json, etc.)
• Removed duplicate test files from root directory
• Cleaned up project root to contain only essential files

Indentation System Features:
• Smart repair based on parent-child relationships
• Multiple iteration passes to handle cascading indentation issues
• Validation of orphaned items and missing parents
• Warning for excessive nesting levels (>10)
• Terminal and HTML export indentation consistency

Files Reorganized:
• analyze_file.py → test/
• check_indent.py → test/
• debug_shopping_list.py → test/
• test_indent_fix.py → test/
• demo_browser_functionality.py → examples/
• demo_editor_commands.py → examples/
• test_browse_demo.py → test/
• test_line_numbers.py → test/
• test_browse_demo.md → test/

Technical Implementation:
• Enhanced _format_line() in TerminalEditor for proper indentation display
• Added repair_indentation() method to MarkdownEditor class
• Integrated indent command into terminal command processor
• Added comprehensive error handling and user feedback

Root directory now contains only:
• main.py (entry point)
• README.md, LICENSE, requirements.txt (documentation)
• libs/, docs/, examples/, test/ (core directories)
• Git configuration files

All indentation features tested and documented.
